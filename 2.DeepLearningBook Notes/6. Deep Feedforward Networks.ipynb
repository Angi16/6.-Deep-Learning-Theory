    "  * For learning to occur, we require a large, predictable gradient to serve as a guide for the weight updates.

    "### <font color='Blue'>Output activations</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The choice of output activations is important since we need to make sure that the gradients of these outputs are not frequently 0, or else learning will not occur. For example, if we use the CE loss with a ReLU ouput unit, the gradient of the output of the model with respect to the last layer will frequently be 0, which when backpropagated, will result in no weight updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Generally, use the sigmoid or softmax activations at the output of a network if you’re optimizing the cross-entropy loss, otherwise have the outputs of your network just be the unchanged affine transformation.\n",
    "  * Sigmoid units can be used for Bernoulli output distributions, or binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * If we were to use a linear unit, then we would have to threshold it, which could lead to difficult gradients to train.\n",
    "  * One useful property of the softmax function is that $softmax(z)=softmax(z+c)$, so we can avoid numerical computation problems by computing $softmax(z)=softmax(z−max_i z_i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### <font color='Blue'>Other Output Types</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you want to learn the variance/covariance of a distribution, you can learn it as a parameter.\n",
    "* Usually we use the perciscion, because the gradient is better behaved. WE usually only learn a diagonal percision/covariance matrix, as learning a full matrix requires O(d^3) time.\n",
    "* For multi-modal regression, we can use a Gaussian mixture model, which are particularly effective in speech generation.\n",

    "* Sigmoidal activation: σ(x)=11+exp(−x)\n",
    "* Derivative is σ(x)(1−σ(x))\n",
    "* It behaves linearly around x=0, and is everywhere differentiable. Also has the interpretation of a probability since the outputs are between 0 and 1, and also gives the “firing rate” of the neuron.\n",
    "* Cons: Saturating gradient at extremes -> gradient is practically 0.\n",
    "* Max value of the gradient is 0.25, so it also always scales down gradients as they are backpropagated through, which also can lead to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "* Another con is that it is centered around $0.5$, not 0. This means that all of the outputs from the sigmoid neuron will be positive, and centered around 0.5. This could result in “zig-zagging” during gradient descent. For concreteness, suppose that $f=∑_i w_i x_i$ and $ \\mathrm{d}f \\mathrm{d} w_i = x_i$. Then if we have a loss $L=∑_i y^i − f(x^i)$, we have \n",

    "* Hyperbolic Tanh: 2σ(x)−1, ddxtanh(x)=1−tanh2(x)\n",
    "*  This is still saturating but less so than the sigmoid, and behaves as a nearly linear unit for more of it’s input range.

    "* Sigmoidal activation: σ(x)=11+exp(−x)\n",
    "* Derivative is σ(x)(1−σ(x))\n",
    "* It behaves linearly around x=0, and is everywhere differentiable. Also has the interpretation of a probability since the outputs are between 0 and 1, and also gives the “firing rate” of the neuron.\n",
    "* Cons: Saturating gradient at extremes -> gradient is practically 0.\n",
    "* Max value of the gradient is 0.25, so it also always scales down gradients as they are backpropagated through, which also can lead to the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "* Another con is that it is centered around $0.5$, not 0. This means that all of the outputs from the sigmoid neuron will be positive, and centered around 0.5. This could result in “zig-zagging” during gradient descent. For concreteness, suppose that $f=∑_i w_i x_i$ and $ \\mathrm{d}f \\mathrm{d} w_i = x_i$. Then if we have a loss $L=∑_i y^i − f(x^i)$, we have \n",
    "$ \\frac {\\mathrm{d} L}{\\mathrm{d} w_i} = \\frac {\\mathrm{d} L}{\\mathrm{d} f} \\frac {\\mathrm{d} f}{\\mathrm{d} w_i} =  \\frac {\\mathrm{d} L}{\\mathrm{d}f }x_i $ This tells us that the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights will always have the same sign, since x_i is positive, the gradients will either be all positive or all negative, resulting in “zig zagging” during gradient descent.\n",
    "* Hyperbolic Tanh: 2σ(x)−1, ddxtanh(x)=1−tanh2(x)\n",
    "*  This is still saturating but less so than the sigmoid, and behaves as a nearly linear unit for more of it’s input range. Also has the property of beign zero-centerred, which means that there will not be much zig-zagging of the weight updates during gradient descent (see above for a more detailed description of this).\n",

    "### <font color='Blue'>The Humble ReLU, and its several variations</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "* ReLU unit is given by $ReLU(x)=max(0,x)$. The local gradient is 1 if $x>0$ else 0. The unit is not differentiable at 0, but we generally assign a value to the derivative at 0 between 0,1.\n",
    "* The pros of the relu unit include faster convergence, behaves linearly when it’s active, and does not scale gradients down during backpropagation, it rather just **“passes them through”** the unit.\n",
    "* However, learning does not happen for examples with 0 activation, which can lead to the “dying ReLU” problem which is when a ReLU neuron never activates, such as if its weights are not initialized properly or if a gradient update knocks them in a certain direction \n",
    "* The softplus unit $log(1+exp(x))$ is a soft approximation of the ReLU who’s derivative is the sigmoid function.\n",
    "* The ** leaky relu** seeks to solve teh dying ReLU problem by passing a smaller gradient when x<0 and the unit is not active in teh forward pass. It is given by $max(αx,x)$ where α is a hyperparameter generally set to some small value like $0.01$. In the similar $PReLU$, this α is actually a parameter that can be optimized during learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The exponential linear unit, or ELU, is another activation function that’s designed to approximate the ReLU but also avoid teh stopping of learning when the unit is not active. It is given by $f(x)=max(α(exp(x)−1),x)$\n",

    "### <font color='Blue'>Output Activations</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Once we have the output socres form our network, we may want to run them through an activation function before calculating our loss or for interpretability purposes.\n",
    "* A popular output activation is the sigmoid or more general softmax, which allows our scores to be interpreted as probabilities.\n",
    "* Based on this, which loss function may be better to use? The $MSE$ given by $L=\\frac {1}{2}∑_i (y^i−σ(z^i))$ or the cross entropy given by $l=−∑_i y_i logσ(z^i)+(1−y_i) log(1−σ(z^i))$. \n",
    "* If we consider the backwards pass, the derivatives are given by −2(yi−σ(zi))σ′(zi), so if z is very large and negative or very large and positive, this gradient will be approximately zero. This isn’t good because it implies that we have a lages loss and an inaccurate prediciton, but essentially zero gadient will be passed down to our weights, leading to extremely slow or nearly no learning (essentially the vanishing gradient problem again).\n",
    "* On the other hand, the derivative for the cross entropy cost can be given by $ \\mathrm{d}CE \\mathrm{d}z_i=σ(z_i)−1$, which is not dependent on the sigmoid derivative. In this case when z is negative and large, then the gradient will have the highest magnitude, and it will only go towards zero when z is positive and large, implying that we have a low loss, which makes sense.\n",

    "* Deeper networka generally have less units per layer and much fewere parameters, but generalize better, but are more computationally complex to train, and harder to optimize, because the vanishing/exploding gradient problem becomes more apparent.\n",
    "* ** Universal Approximation Theorem ** states that a neural network with a single hidden layer with a nonlinearity can approximate any function. Essentially, we know that for any function that we are trying to learn, we know that there exists a setting of the params for the neural network such that we will be albe to represent that function, but this theorem ** says nothing about our ability to learn that function **.\n",
    "    This theorem does not really apply well in practice, because the hidden layer generally has to be extremely large and the training algorithm will overfit on the training dataset.\n",
