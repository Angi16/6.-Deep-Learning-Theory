    "* Statistical learning theory gives us some ideas on how to get a better expected testing error. First, we note that the training and test data both come from the same underlying probability distribution, often referred to as teh data generating distribution. Generally, we assume that the examples in our dataset are independent of each other and identically distributed (drawn form the same probability distribution). This distribution is called $p_{data}$ and we seek to approximate it.\n",
    "*************\n",
    "## <font color='Blue'>Underfitting & Overfitting<font>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model capacity refers to its ability to fit a wide variety of functions. For example, a polynomial model has higher capacity than a linear model.\n",
    "* When a model’s capacity is too low for a particular task, they tend to underfit, when it’s too high, they tend to overfit.\n",
    "* If you have n examples then you can perfectly fit with a model of degree n−1. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything though. When you have more parameters than features, there are an infinte amount of functions that can git your data, and it’s hard to select the one that generalizes the best.\n",
    "* While simpler functions are more likely to generalize, we need to be able to have a complex enough hypothesis in order to get lowe training error.\n",
    "* **VC dimension** is a model capacity measure - a model’s VC dimeision is the largest possible m such that the model can fit a dataset of m different points.\n",
    "* **Nearest neighbor regression**: when a model is asked to classify/predict, it just looks up the k nearest neighbors (according to some distance metric, which itself can be learned, and returns the most common label/prediction)\n",
    "* **Non parametric** models don’t have fixed sized parameters.\n",
    "* **Bayes error** refers to the error an oracle who has access to the true porbability dstribution $p(x,y)$ would get.\n",
    "* **No free lunch theorem** states that no machine learning model is better than another when classifying examples over all possible data generating distributions - all models do the same when evaluated over **all possible tasks**. This means that there’s no machine learning algorithm that’s universally better than another one, but certain algorithms are obviously better for certain tasks.\n",

    "## <font color='Blue'>Maximum Likelihood Estimation<font>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Essentially the goal is to find the parameter $θ$ that maximizes our probability of observing our training data $X=x_1…x_m$.For example, if we have a datset of $(x,y)$ pairs and want to estimate the parameters θ that maximize our probability of observing these pairs, we can write down the likelihood invoking the iid assmputions: $L(θ)=∏_i p(x_i,y_i ∣ θ)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another interpretation of the MLE is that it minimizes teh ference between 2 probability distributions: one which si given by your learned parameters θ and the other which is the true underlying data generating distribution. The **KL divergence** is a measure of difference between two probability distributions, and is closely related to the **cross entropy** loss. Minimizing this is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood.\n",

    "*******************\n",
    "## <font color='Blue'>Bayesian Linear Regression<font>\n",

    "The main difference is that in addition to expressing our likelihood as $p(y∣x,θ)=N(y;xw,Σ)$ we condition our paramters θ on a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance λ.

    "* Next, we can replace the examples x with a feature transformation $ϕ(x)$, which takes x and possibly expands it to a very large dimensional vector. Then, we’d have to compute the feature transformations $ϕ(x)$ and the inner products $ϕ(x)^Tϕ(x^i)$. This can turn out to be extremely expensive, or for some feature spaces, impossible.\n",
    "* This is where the kernel comes in. We replace the expensive inner product $ϕ(x)^Tϕ(x^i)$ with a function of variables in the original feature space: $k(x,x^i)$\n",
    "* This means that by computing this function, we can represent the dot product in a high dimensional feature space without actually computing the vector in that feature space and taking the dot product.\n",

    "* An example of an unsupervised learning algorithm is $PCA$. The goal is to take data in a high dimensional space and project it to a lower dimensional space. Concretely, we have a design matrix $X∈R^{n∗m} $ and wish to map $X$ to an $n∗p$ matrix so that it’s in p dimensional space, where $p<m$. This is done by applying a linear transformation to $X$, namely multiplying it with a matrix that is of demision $m∗p$. It turns out that this matrix is composed of the top p eigenvectors of $X^TX$.\n",

We can also think of these directions of variation as transformations. For example, rotating an object may move a training example along it’s manifold. The data is assumed to come from a concentrated probability distributions, that can be represented by manifolds.
